# Tap Game – Flutter Mini Project

A simple and fun two-player tap game built using **Flutter**.  
The screen is divided into two colored sections (Blue & Red).  
Each player taps their area to increase their score and expand their section.  
The player who fills most of the screen first wins the game.
